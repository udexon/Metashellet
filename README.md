# Phos Metashellet
A Forth derived Reverse Polish Notation shell for metaprogramming, embeddable in any program, any programming language and any operting system.

<hr>

The purpose of this web page is to introduce Phos Metashellet, a programmable shell with a simple programming language that ___anyone can learn___, which ultimately ___unifies both programming and mathematics___.

Metashellet is derived from metaprogramming and shell. "Shellet", literally "a smaller shell", implies that it can be embedded in any program, any programming language and any operting system, as the subtitle of this page suggests.

Some readers may wonder, why would "anyone" want to learn metaprogramming, or something that "unifies programming and mathematis"?

The answers to this question are like layers of an onion.

The most immediate benefit is to learn a programming language that can be used to simplify ANY programming language, from Python, JavaScript, PHP to Java, C, C++, Haskell, Go, Rust, LISP, etc ... This immediately solves one of the biggest problems in the computing industry -- age discrimination and obsolesence, i.e. older programmers do not need to be "retired" as they can now use Phos, derived from Forth, as an interface to any new programming language, framework, environment or operating system.

#### Metaprogramming, Computer Algebra Systems and Mathematics

Next, the readers may wonder, even if Phos helps programmers master any and all programming languages, why "metaprogramming", i.e. to learn "how to program a program tha can be used to program another program"?

The short answer is that, metaprogramming is the bridge to artificial intelligence and unifying programming and mathematics.

The long answer is .... many possible PhD theses.

Now seriously, by "unifying programming and mathematics", we mean we can use _one common notation or programming language for programming and representing mathematical equations, as well as analysing and solving them_.

WOW .... WOW .... WOW .... You may wonder ....

Here's the proof:

#### Cloudless Computing and ID-less Transaction

ID-less transactions (messaging) and metashellet can be used to simulate human speech, human language and human like artificial intelligence. .... examples ....

#### Long Term Goals of Metashellet

Emphasize: 
- as easy as Excel, 
- everyone learn one word at a time, build cloudless computing, 
- free software revolution 2.0, clone MAGAF, owned by everyone, 
- absolute privacy via ID-less transactions.Â

The name Metashellet is perhaps yet another evolving term, conceived to describe a simple yet complicated module, embeddable in any program, any programming language and any operting system, that is perhaps the most significant breakthrough in computing technology since the invention of the World Wide Web, iPhone and Androi.

As such, describing metashellet to ordinary users today could be like explaining WWW to men in the street before it was invented, similarly with iPhone and Android. 

Perhaps the best place to start when illustrating metashellet is the Turtle Academy website, an educational website to demonstrate the LOGO programming language for drawing simple to complex shapes on a web page:

https://turtleacademy.com/

Perhaps the take away lessons from Turtle Academy are:

- anyone can learn to program with a simple programming language
- a simple programming language like LOGO can draw simple to complex shapes

These simple principles have been lost in recent years as more complex programming languages become mainstream, with perhaps Python being regarded as "the simplest" of them all.

no more difficult than Excel

unifying programming and mathematics

So it is one of our goals to .... and beyond ....

less is more, KISS keep it simple stu***
