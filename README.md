# Metashellet
A Forth derived Reverse Polish Notation shell for metaprogramming, embeddable in any program, any programming language and any operting system.

The name Metashellet is perhaps yet another evolving term, conceived to describe a simple yet complicated module, embeddable in any program, any programming language and any operting system, that is perhaps the most significant breakthrough in computing technology since the invention of the World Wide Web, iPhone and Androi.

As such, describing metashellet to ordinary users today could be like explaining WWW to men in the street before it was invented, similarly with iPhone and Android. 

Perhaps the best place to start when illustrating metashellet is the Turtle Academy website, an educational website to demonstrate the LOGO programming language for drawing simple to complex shapes on a web page:

Perhaps the take away lessons from Turtle Academy are:

- anyone can learn to program with a simple programming language
- a simple programming language like LOGO can draw simple to complex shapes

These simple principles have been lost in recent years as more complex programming languages become mainstream, with perhaps Python being regarded as "the simplest" of them all.

less is more, KISS keep it simple stu***
