# Metashellet
A Forth derived Reverse Polish Notation shell for metaprogramming, embeddable in any program, any programming language and any operting system.

The name Metashellet is yet another evolving term, conceived to describe a simple yet complicated module, embeddable in any program, any programming language and any operting system, that is perhaps the most significant breakthrough in computing technology since the invention of the World Wide Web, iPhone and Androi.
