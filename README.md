# Phos Metashellet
A Forth derived Reverse Polish Notation shell for metaprogramming, embeddable in any program, any programming language and any operting system.

<hr>

The purpose of this web page is to introduce Phos Metashellet, a programmable shell with a simple programming language that ___anyone can learn___, which ultimately ___unifies both programming and mathematics___.

Metashellet is derived from metaprogramming and shell. "Shellet", literally "a smaller shell", implies that it can be embedded in any program, any programming language and any operating system, as the subtitle of this page suggests.

Some readers may wonder, why would "anyone" want to learn metaprogramming, or something that "unifies programming and mathematis"?

The answers to this question are like layers of an onion.

The most immediate benefit is to learn a programming language that can be used to simplify ANY programming language, from Python, JavaScript, PHP to Java, C, C++, Haskell, Go, Rust, LISP, etc ... This immediately solves one of the biggest problems in the computing industry -- age discrimination and obsolesence, i.e. older programmers do not need to be "retired" as they can now use Phos, derived from Forth, as an interface to any new programming language, framework, environment or operating system.

#### Metaprogramming, Computer Algebra Systems and Mathematics

Next, the readers may wonder, even if Phos helps programmers master any and all programming languages, why "metaprogramming", i.e. to learn "how to program a program tha can be used to program another program"?

The short answer is that, metaprogramming is the bridge to artificial intelligence and unifying programming and mathematics.

The long answer is .... many possible PhD theses.

Now seriously, by "unifying programming and mathematics", we mean we can use _one common notation or programming language for programming and representing mathematical equations, as well as analysing and solving them_.

WOW .... WOW .... WOW .... You may wonder ....

Here's the proof:

#### Cloudless Computing and ID-less Transaction

https://github.com/udexon/DatongToken/blob/master/Datong_3_in_1.md

ID-less transactions (messaging) and metashellet can be used to simulate human speech, human language and human like artificial intelligence. .... examples ....

#### Long Term Goals of Metashellet

We provide training on Metashellet to achieve the following:

- provide the necessary skills to recruited programmers to work together to develop free and open source software (FOSS) using metashellet methodology.
       
- Metashellet provides a simple programming language based on Forth, perhaps as easy as Microsoft Excel, that can be targeted to non-programmers from 5 years old to 75 years old, revolutionizing education in programming and mathematics.

- a little known feature of Forth, colon definition, which uses the term "word" to describe function name, allows users to arbitrarily rename or alias function names, including using Unicode to represent native mother tongue words, not only helps non Latin learners tremendously, but it litetally lets everyone "learn one word at a time", making learning programming as easy as (Lotus) 1-2-3 (the world's top spreadsheet software that predated Microsoft Excel).

If Free Software Revolution 1.0 is the creation of GNU Linux tools and the subsequent development that created the Internet and mobile infrastructure that we have today, we shall define Free Software Revolution as free software programmersÂ  CLONING existing mobile and Internet platforms owned by MAGAF (Microsoft Apple Google Amazon Facebook) and other tech giants, to create platforms that are owned by EVERYONE, not single corporations. Metashellet and ID-less transactions will gvie rise to Cloudless Computing to realize Free Software Revolution 2.0.

ID-less transactions: the Unix User ID convention, based on symmetric cryptography, has shaped perhaps all of today authentication systems by way of GNU Linux free software movement. Although asymmetric cryptography has been widely used in many applications, e.g. cryptocurrencies, they are not completely removed from Unix style user ID, perhaps due to preconditioned mindset of the developers. Also based on asymmetric cryptography, our ID-less transactions protocol (XIDT) is a radical creation that departs completely from the principles and philosophies of Unix User ID, making it possible to serve as an intermediate and interface system amongst existing centralized Unix style authentication systems.

#### Less is More, Keep It Simple Stu***

The name Metashellet is perhaps yet another evolving term, conceived to describe a simple yet complicated module, embeddable in any program, any programming language and any operting system, that is perhaps the most significant breakthrough in computing technology since the invention of the World Wide Web, iPhone and Android.

As such, describing metashellet to ordinary users today could be like explaining WWW to men in the street before it was invented, similarly with iPhone and Android. 

Perhaps the best place to start when illustrating metashellet is the Turtle Academy website, an educational website to demonstrate the LOGO programming language for drawing simple to complex shapes on a web page:

https://turtleacademy.com/

Perhaps the take away lessons from Turtle Academy are:

- anyone can learn to program with a simple programming language
- a simple programming language like LOGO can draw simple to complex shapes

These simple principles have been lost in recent years as more complex programming languages become mainstream, with perhaps Python being regarded as "the simplest" of them all.

Incidentally, a turtle graphics library has been ported to Python:

https://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/simple_drawing.html

We shall demonstrate that how a Phos Metashellet written in Python can extend the functionalities of turtle graphics into something more ambitious, while keeping the programming language to be no more complicated than Microsoft Excel.

So this will be is one of the first few simple steps in our journey .... to ultimately unifying programming and mathematics with Phos Metashellet.
