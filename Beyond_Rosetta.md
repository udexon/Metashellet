### Metashellet: Bringing Rosetta Code to the Next Level

- Currently, code on Rosetta Code cannot be used as components of large applications without substantial modifications.
- With Phos Metashellet, each function in Rosetta Code can be stored as function words and be reused in larger programs, eventually building up the [Phos Universal Function Library](https://github.com/udexon/Metashellet/blob/master/Beyond_Rosetta.md#project-a-phos-universal-function-library-phunilib), spanning across all known programming languages and operating systems.
- Of course, such benefits are not just restricted to Rosetta Code, but any function in open source repositories such as GitHub or equivalent can also be reused as function words in Phos Metashellet.


#### The New Tower of Babel &mdash; Free Software Revolution 2.0

The tale of the [Tower of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel) has been brought to every corner of the Earth, thanks to [Chinese merchants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howqua) funding European Christian colonizers.

(Yes. We are here to reveal One Belt One Road is not a modern China Communist Party invention. We have been doing it secretly ever since the first Portugese and Spanish merchants set foot on Chinese soils, funding them to become the Mega Christian Empires that conquer the world, where the Chinese rule by proxy.)

What will happen if the "programmers of the world, unite!", using a single super language to clone all the MAGAF (Microsoft Apple Google Amazon Facebook) platforms, thus challenging the "Gods" of today's IT world?

(And now we are doing it again to challenge MAGAF.)

[Phos Metashellet](https://github.com/udexon/Metashellet/blob/master/README.md) is a Forth derived Reverse Polish Notation shell for metaprogramming, embeddable in any program, any programming language and any operting system. We coin the name Phos as it rhymes with Forth, and it means "light" in Greek, which dispels the darkness of the IT world, as was inscribed in [the Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_there_be_light).

Phos Metashellet will bring the [Rosetta Code project](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code)) to the next level, becoming the Tower of Babel project for free software programmers.

How does it work?

- Phos Metashellet can be used to [___simplify ANY programming language___](https://github.com/udexon/Metashellet/blob/master/README.md#simplifying-any-programming-language). 

Metashellet can be implemented in any programming language starting from a mere 20 lines of code of the host programming language [(demos)](https://github.com/udexon/Metashellet/blob/master/README.md#phos-metashellet-for-php-and-javascript). 

Based on a simplified implementation of Forth, Phos Metashellet retains the following Forth features of a stack machine shell:
- reading inputs from stack and writing outputs to stack
- branch
- colon definition words (aliases)

Novelties:
- intergration with host programming language
- one stack per data type
- Unicode function words (complete mapping of Latin words, essential for learning programming in non-Latin native languages)

Forth has been implemented in various high level host programming languages as follow:

- https://github.com/udexon/GOEHDOM/blob/master/Forth_ports.md

In most of these Forth ports, the developers did not focus on high level issues, e.g. integrating mainstream, host programming language functions, into the Forth framework, but rather, satisfied themselves with executing a partial set of Forth words (function names in Forth lingo). As such, integrating with functions of host programming languages becomes one of the main goals of Phos Metashellet:

Question: Programmers today may ask:
- Is there anything else I can do besides writing small pieces of code for my company's project?

Answer: Contribute to the [Free Software Revolution 2.0](https://github.com/udexon/Metashellet/blob/master/README.md#free-software-revolution-20), by developing Phos "colon definition words", to build up a ___Universal Function Library___, that consists of all functions in any programming language, in any operating system, ever written by human programmers.

- If Free Software Revolution 1.0 is the creation of GNU Linux tools essentially CLONING proprietary Unix functionalities, and the subsequent development that created the Internet and mobile infrastructure that we have today, we shall define Free Software Revolution 2.0 as free software programmers CLONING existing mobile and Internet platforms owned by MAGAF (Microsoft Apple Google Amazon Facebook) and other tech giants, to create a Cloudless Computing platform that are owned by EVERYONE, not single monolith faceless corporations.

- [Colon Definition Words](https://github.com/udexon/Metashellet#long-term-goals-of-metashellet), where the term "word" is used to describe function name, allows users to arbitrarily rename or alias function names, including using Unicode to represent native mother tongue words, not only helps non Latin learners tremendously, but it literally lets everyone "learn one word at a time", making learning programming as easy as (Lotus) 1-2-3 (the world's top spreadsheet software that predated Microsoft Excel).


Question: How can anyone who contributes to the Universal Function Library project be rewarded?

Answers: 
- [International Money Transfer (including Cryptocurrencies) and Online Tipping](https://github.com/udexon/EMYL/blob/master/E003_Online_Tipping.md)
- [A New Type of Blockchain based on ID-less Transactions](https://github.com/udexon/XIDT#a-new-type-of-blockchain-based-on-id-less-transactions)

The Phos Universal Function Library (Phunilib) and cloning MAGAF platforms (Phos Cloudless Computing, Phocless) represent the two ends of the spectrum of the Free Software Revolution 2.0, which ___AYNONE___, from 5 years old to 75 years old, programmers and non-programmers can contribute.


#### Phos Metashellet Project List

We may label Phunilib Project A and Phocless Project Z, so that we may label and arrange other projects mentioned in this article and elsewhere B to Y, to signify the chronological order that we may execute them.

The following projects B, C and E are taken from [ID-less Transactions (XIDT) Demos](https://github.com/udexon/XIDT#id-less-transactions-xidt-demos):

- short term A, B, C;
- medium term E, F, G, H;
- long term I, J, K;
...
- final goals X, Y, Z.


#### Project A: Phos Universal Function Library (Phunilib)

Two essential steps for Phunilib:
- colon definition words: Every function in any programming language in any operating system, can be mapped as a function word in Phos Metashellet. ( [More details ...](https://github.com/udexon/UCollab/blob/master/UCollab_1203.md) )
- build database with [XIDT (ID-less Transactions)](https://github.com/udexon/XIDT): Every programmer may build a database server for the Phos Universal Function Library hosted on a mobile device, desktop computer or virtual machine. A distributed database infrastructure can be constructed using XIDT.

Authentication is an essential step in network applications, including database etc. Almost all authentication systems today employ centralizedÂ Unix style user ID authentication, including database management systems. XIDT may be used to implement a novel type of DBMS, either by interfacing to an existing Unix style user ID DBMS, or developing the DBMS system completely from scratch.


#### Project D: Programmer Apprenticeship Networks

We find it rather curious that despite the great number of social networks that have been created, none of them is dedicated to helping trainers training trainees, enabling trainers and trainess to form larger networks, which may then be able to challenge huge corporations. 

(Tower of Babel) What is missing from the tale of the Tower of Babel might just be this -- the apprentice networks employed at that time and passed down through generations until industrialization destroyed them, to be replaced with faceless corporate hierarchy. 

- D1 ReddBuddies and D2 Proletariat Programmers (ProlProgs)

- Question: How many % of programmers may acquire skills from zero to be employable by companies or earning sufficient income from contract projects within 6 months, with or without experienced senior's guidance?

We suspect no one has an up to date, systematic and comprehensive answer to this critical question, that does not just affect the lives of programmers, but economies of the world, as programming is now vital to every field of human activities.

Economics is perhaps yet another subject intentionally made overcomplicated by so called "experts" so that ordinary people cannot learn the language that will influence public policy decision makers, thus monopolized by giant faceless banks and corporations.

When we consider programmer apprenticeship in large scale, then it becomes apparent that perhaps ordinary people's income can be improved greatly if we have an effective and efficient programmer apprenticeship network. All these questions can of course be simulated easily given today's technology and talents. This project can perhaps be included as a subproject of Project E (International Money Transfer with XIDT).


#### Project E: [International Money Transfer (including Cryptocurrencies) and Online Tipping](https://github.com/udexon/EMYL/blob/master/E003_Online_Tipping.md)


Let us consider the man months required to develop Project E and its potential revenues.

Project E is a relatively small application in terms of footprint but can have huge significance in terms of potential number of users).

We estimate Project E requires 12 man months to complete. If we can find 60 programmers who can contribute 8 hours a week (5 times less than 40 hours a week), we may complete it in 1 month.

Suppose we get 100 users to transfer USD10 per month during the first month, and doubling the users every month, we would have the following revenues:
- Month 1: USD 1k
- Month 2: USD 2k
- Month 3: USD 8k
- Month 4: USD 16k
- Month 5: USD 32k
- Month 6: USD 64k


#### Project H: Inter-games Communications

One of the most immediate and profitable applications of XIDT is inter-game communications. Metashellet basically enables programming any element inside a game using text string input. As long as the source code of a game is available, or a core developer implements metashellet in the game, metashellet programming will be available to all users.Â 

XIDT will then enable decentralized authentication amongst users, thus making communications between different games possible.

Eventually, all existing game platforms today can become clusters in a hypergame platform, connected using XIDT, programmed by users and developers using metashellets.Â 



#### Conclusions

From the list of Phos Metashellet projects above, we may say that they are indeed unprecedented in human history in many respects:

- They make use of free time of free software programmers, from beginners to experts. Theoretically, the cumulative free time of free software programmers is a very large number, but has not been systematically quantified, except using the number of lines committed to free software repositories such as GitHub or equivalent.

- They show that nothing is too big to conquer, just like the Tower of Babel. Of course no body actually knew what happened which made the workers of the Tower of Babel disintegrated. But as history has proven time and again, proletariat workers and farmers unite time and again, bringing forth (pun!!) revolutions after revolutions. The next revolution, the Free Software Revolution 2.0, might just be the most invisible and yet as significant as the many proletariat revolutions in the past.

- The Free Software Revolution 2.0 might just be the threshold that will usher in the Star Trek society. If the year 2020 A.D. (C.E.) is marked by Trump and Coronavirus and the biggest global economic depression since Wordl War II, then perhaps Free Software Revolution 2.0 may unleash several essential elements that will shape a new era, much like how national currencies, automobiles, air travel and Internet shaped the post WWII period.

The post war financial system could be considered as the single biggest factor that brought about unprecedented development and yet equal or perhaps inequalities in human history. Although the invention of cryptocurrencies since 2009 has caused some proponents to see hope, all the existing cryptocurrencies are still based on the decades old centralized Unix style user ID authentication system, which had become the biggest obstacle for user adoption, where 1 in 1000 can be considered an optimistic estimate, as what users really want is something as convenient as the gold and silver coins that were in use prior to WWII, i.e. there is no need to register oneself as a user before one can start using the system, together with the anonymity that was inherent. 

The ID-less Transactions (XIDT) project promises to solve this problem. Further, the colon definition word mechanism derived from Forth would enable better and more efficient collaborative software development amongst free software programmers, from begineers to experts.

The wager to test our hypothesis, as described above, is whether we are able to recruit a mere 60 voluntary (or incentivized) collaborators to complete the XIDT money transfer prototype in 1 months, or 10 collaborators in 6 months.
