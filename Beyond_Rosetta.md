Metashellet: Bringing Rosetta Code to the Next Level

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel

The tale of the Tower of Babel has been brought to every corner of the Earth, thanks to [Chinese merchants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howqua) funding European Christian colonizers.

(Yes. We are here to reveal One Belt One Road is not a modern China Communist Party invention. We have been doing it secretly ever since the first Portugese and Spanish merchants set foot on Chinese soils, funding them to become the Mega Christian Empires that conquer the world, where the Chinese rule by proxy.)

What will happen if the "programmers of the world, unite!", using a single super language to clone all the MAGAF (Microsoft Apple Google Amazon Facebook) platforms, thus challenging the "Gods" of today's IT world?

(And now we are doing it again to challenge MAGAF.)

Phos Metashellet is a Forth derived Reverse Polish Notation shell for metaprogramming, embeddable in any program, any programming language and any operting system. We coin the name Phos as it rhymes with Forth, and it means "light" in Greek, which dispels the darkness of the IT world, as was inscribed in [the Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_there_be_light).

Phos Metashellet will bring the Rosetta Code project to the next level, becoming the Tower of Babel project for free software programmers.
