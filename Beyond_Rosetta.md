### Metashellet: Bringing Rosetta Code to the Next Level

- Currently, code on Rosetta Code cannot be used as components of large applications without substantial modifications.
- With Phos Metashellet, each function in Rosetta Code can be stored as function words and be reused in larger programs. 
- Of course, such benefits are not just restricted to Rosetta Code, but any function in open source repositories such as GitHub or equivalent can also be reused as function words in Phos Metashellet.

The tale of the Tower of Babel has been brought to every corner of the Earth, thanks to [Chinese merchants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howqua) funding European Christian colonizers.

(Yes. We are here to reveal One Belt One Road is not a modern China Communist Party invention. We have been doing it secretly ever since the first Portugese and Spanish merchants set foot on Chinese soils, funding them to become the Mega Christian Empires that conquer the world, where the Chinese rule by proxy.)

What will happen if the "programmers of the world, unite!", using a single super language to clone all the MAGAF (Microsoft Apple Google Amazon Facebook) platforms, thus challenging the "Gods" of today's IT world?

(And now we are doing it again to challenge MAGAF.)

[Phos Metashellet](https://github.com/udexon/Metashellet/blob/master/README.md) is a Forth derived Reverse Polish Notation shell for metaprogramming, embeddable in any program, any programming language and any operting system. We coin the name Phos as it rhymes with Forth, and it means "light" in Greek, which dispels the darkness of the IT world, as was inscribed in [the Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_there_be_light).

Phos Metashellet will bring the Rosetta Code project to the next level, becoming the Tower of Babel project for free software programmers.

How does it work?

- Phos Metashellet can be used to [___simplify ANY programming language___](https://github.com/udexon/Metashellet/blob/master/README.md#simplifying-any-programming-language). 

Metashellet can be implemented in any programming language starting from a mere 20 lines of code of the host programming language [(demos)](https://github.com/udexon/Metashellet/blob/master/README.md#phos-metashellet-for-php-and-javascript). 

Based on a simplified implementation of Forth, Phos Metashellet retains the following Forth features of a stack machine shell:
- reading inputs from stack and writing outputs to stack
- branch
- colon definition words (aliases)

Novelties:
- intergration with host programming language
- one stack per data type
- Unicode function words (complete mapping of Latin words, essential for learning programming in non-Latin native languages)

Forth has been implemented in various high level host programming languages as follow:

- https://github.com/udexon/GOEHDOM/blob/master/Forth_ports.md

In most of these Forth ports, the developers did not focus on high level issues, e.g. integrating mainstream, host programming language functions, into the Forth framework, but rather, satisfied themselves with executing a partial set of Forth words (function names in Forth lingo). As such, integrating with functions of host programming languages becomes one of the main goals of Phos Metashellet:

Question: Programmers today may ask:
- Is there anything else I can do besides writing small pieces of code for my company's project?

Answer: Contribute to the [Free Software Revolution 2.0](https://github.com/udexon/Metashellet/blob/master/README.md#free-software-revolution-20), by developing Phos "colon definition words", to build up a ___Universal Function Library___, that consists of all functions in any programming language, in any operating system, ever written by human programmers.

- If Free Software Revolution 1.0 is the creation of GNU Linux tools essentially CLONING proprietary Unix functionalities, and the subsequent development that created the Internet and mobile infrastructure that we have today, we shall define Free Software Revolution 2.0 as free software programmers CLONING existing mobile and Internet platforms owned by MAGAF (Microsoft Apple Google Amazon Facebook) and other tech giants, to create a Cloudless Computing platform that are owned by EVERYONE, not single monolith faceless corporations.

- [Colon Definition Words](https://github.com/udexon/Metashellet#long-term-goals-of-metashellet), where the term "word" is used to describe function name, allows users to arbitrarily rename or alias function names, including using Unicode to represent native mother tongue words, not only helps non Latin learners tremendously, but it literally lets everyone "learn one word at a time", making learning programming as easy as (Lotus) 1-2-3 (the world's top spreadsheet software that predated Microsoft Excel).


Question: How can anyone who contributes to the Universal Function Library project be rewarded?

Answers: 
- [International Money Transfer (including Cryptocurrencies) and Online Tipping](https://github.com/udexon/EMYL/blob/master/E003_Online_Tipping.md)
- [A New Type of Blockchain based on ID-less Transactions](https://github.com/udexon/XIDT#a-new-type-of-blockchain-based-on-id-less-transactions)

The Phos Universal Function Library (Phunilib) and cloning MAGAF platforms (Phos Cloudless Computing, Phocless) represent the two ends of the spectrum of the Free Software Revolution 2.0, which ___AYNONE___, from 5 years old to 75 years old, programmers and non-programmers can contribute.


#### Phos Metashellet Project List

We may label Phunilib Project A and Phocless Project Z, so that we may label and arrange other projects mentioned in this article and elsewhere B to Y, to signify the chronological order that we may execute them.

The following projects B to D are taken from [ID-less Transactions (XIDT) Demos](https://github.com/udexon/XIDT#id-less-transactions-xidt-demos):

- A: Phos Universal Function Library (Phunilib)
- B: RSA Encryption / Decryption using Phos Metashellet
- C: "Greet with a Secret Phrase" Protocol
- D: D1 ReddBuddies, D2 Proletariat Programmers (ProlProgs)
- ...
- E: International Money Transfer (including Cryptocurrencies) and Online Tipping
- F: N Roulette
- G: Inter-game communications
- ...
- Y: Robotics and Artificial Intelligence
- Z: cloning MAGAF platforms (Phos Cloudless Computing, Phocless)

#### A: Phos Universal Function Library (Phunilib)

Two essential steps for Phunilib:
- colon definition words: Every function in any programming language in any operating system, can be mapped as a function word in Phos Metashellet.
- build database with XIDT (ID-less Transactions): Every programmer may build a database server for the Phos Universal Function Library hosted on a mobile device, desktop computer or virtual machine. A distributed database infrastructure can be constructed using XIDT.

Authentication is an essential step in network applications, including database etc. Almost all authentication systems today employ centralized Unix style user ID authentication, including database management systems. XIDT may be used to implement a novel type of DBMS, either by interfacing to an existing Unix style user ID DBMS, or developing the DBMS system completely from scratch.

Project D is a relatively small application in terms of footprint but can have huge significance in terms of potential number of users).

One of the most immediate and profitable applications of XIDT is inter-game communications. Metashellet basically enables programming any element inside a game using text string input. As long as the source code of a game is available, or a core developer implements metashellet in the game, metashellet programming will be available to all users. 

XIDT will then enable decentralized authentication amongst users, thus making communications between different games possible.

Eventually, all existing game platforms today can become clusters in a hypergame platform, connected using XIDT, programmed by users and developers using metashellets.
